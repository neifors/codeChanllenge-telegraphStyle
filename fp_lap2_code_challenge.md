# LAP 2 Code Challenge
You're nearly halfway through the course! We know that it's not easy, well done! Sometimes we need a place to write down our thoughts, but we may wish to remain anonymous doing so!

Base your design aesthetic on a platform such as [Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/).

You will be working in pairs for this challenge and teaming up with another pair to give feedback via PR review.

## Requirements
- Your app should have a browser client allowing users to write a post with a title, a pseudonym and a body
- No login should be required to create a post or visit a post
- When a user hits 'publish', the post should be stored in a database and the client redirected to a show path
- The user should be able to access their post using that show path even after a server restart
- Edit and delete functionality is not required


## Timeline
- Tuesday PM & Wednesday AM: Work on challenge in pairs
#### Wednesday
- 1pm: It's lunchtime! All work to have been pushed to a GitHub repo with review requested from another pair.
- 2pm: Review the request sent to you by the other pair
- 3pm: Meet with the other pair to discuss the comments that have been made.
- 4pm: Take your feedback and use it to implement any changes and improvements.

## Tips
- Create a new repo on GitHub early and push a basic README.md
- Very early on, before you've pushed any more code to GitHub, [make a new branch on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) called review/feedback/free-beer, whatever you like. Don’t push or merge anything to it, we’ll use it tomorrow for review purposes.
- When you find out who your review partners are, [add them as collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
- When ready to submit for review, make all final commits and push to your working branch
- Make a Pull Request ***to*** your review branch, ***from*** your working branch
- **Do not** merge this PR!
- Request review on your PR by adding your review partners as reviewers by clicking the cog next to 'Reviewers' on the pull request page
- Keep an eye out in your own email and/or [GitHub notifications](https://github.com/notifications?query=reason%3Areview-requested) to see when you have been requested to review another team's work!
